Homework for the [first module](https://github.com/Data-Learn/data-engineering/tree/master/DE-101%20Modules/Module01/DE%20-%20101%20Lab%201.1)

Where I had to simulate the work of an online store and help management make a report on revenue. In this folder you can see the visualization of the architecture of the analytical solution.

But I decided to move away from the main task and decided to produce my own database on PostgreSQL, which is deployed on Docker and Python scripts (with the Dash library), which import this data and produce a dashboard

The solution architecture for this module is below
