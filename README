My project is an educational project that I modified from the <a href="https://github.com/Data-Learn/data-engineering">Data Learn</a> of the lessons.

Our task is to create your own Git repository, where you can store your work, and we can then check it after completing the course. 

Where we implemented a test project for an Internet site with sales and their analytics in the form of a dashboard.
